# GameJam-Nate-Precious

A Game Jam game in the bullet heaven style with a slight mixture of 2D and 3D styling. It requires PaperZD to open the unreal project.

This was done over the course of 2 days and a collection of setbacks for a game jam held by General Motors internally.

Would generally classify this as an exercise in what not to done when undertaking a long form team based project. Between the two of us and the time laid out a lot of decisions were made that would traditionally be frowned upon and outright unstable, however despite this the game does still function albeit with a very small amount of features.
